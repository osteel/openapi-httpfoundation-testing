# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on Github.

## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-12 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-12-extended-coding-style-guide.md)** - Fix the code's style with `composer fix`.

- **[PHPStan level 9](https://phpstan.org/user-guide/rule-levels)** - Check compliance with `composer type`.

- **Add tests!** - Your contribution won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests â€“ Run the test suite with `composer test`.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your main branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful.

**Happy coding**!
